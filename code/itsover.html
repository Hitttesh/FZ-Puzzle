	<h1><mark>THe weiRD End</mark></h1>
	<p><mark> You scream in both terror and annoyance, your voice echoing through the seemingly infinite slide. "What kind of horror comedy puzzle is this?!" you yell.Just as Jack was about to give up, the slide abruptly came to a halt. He landed with a thud in a small, brightly lit room filled with confetti and balloons. Startled but relieved, he dusted himself off and looked around. <br>

        To his surprise, he found himself surrounded by an audience of strange and eccentric creatures. They were clapping and cheering, their eyes filled with amusement. A tall, lanky figure with a top hat stepped forward, bowing theatrically. <br><br>
        
        "Congratulations, Jack!" the figure exclaimed with a flourish. "You've endured the ultimate slide of absurdity! We hope you enjoyed this never-ending escapade of comedic chaos." <br><br>
        
        Confetti rained down from above as the audience erupted in laughter and applause. Jack couldn't help but laugh along, realizing that this bizarre and seemingly endless slide was nothing more than a playful prank. <br><br>
        
        With a smile on his face, he accepted the applause and bowed to the peculiar crowd. It may not have been the expected end to his horror comedy puzzle, but it was a weird and wacky conclusion that he would never forget.</mark></p>
